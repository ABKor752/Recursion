# Factorial
This is a great first problem for recursion beginners. The factorial n! of a positive integer n is defined as follows:
\\[n! = n \cdot (n - 1) \cdot (n - 2) \cdot \ldots \cdot 2 \cdot 1\\]
For instance, the factorial of 5 would be 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.
In `Factorial_workspace.cpp`, implement the `int factorial(int n)` function, which computes the factorial of the integer n. Your solution MUST use recursion.
