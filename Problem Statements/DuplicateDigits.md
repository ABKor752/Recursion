# Duplicate Digits
For an integer n, we say that n has *duplicate digits* if it contains two of the same
digit next to one another. For instance, 112, 3224, and -59886 all have duplicate digits,
but 121, 7674, and 0 do not.

In `DuplicateDigits_workspace.cpp`, implement the `duplicateDigits` function which returns
true if and only if n contains duplicate digits. However, **you may not use any loops
in your implementation**. Think about how you can use recursion to get around this
restriction.
