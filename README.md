# Recursion
Welcome! This repository is meant for those who wish to learn about recursion in computer science. Each practice problem is accompanied by a problem description, solution, and explanation. All solutions are implemented in C++, though the solution explanations are written in pseudocode translatable to any language.

Each .cpp file can be organized into the following categories:
* Workspace. This is where the user can implement their solution according to the problem statement.
  * `[problem]_workspace.cpp`
* Solution. This is the C++ solution to the corresponding problem statement. These files include comments, however full solution explanations are provided elsewhere.
  * `[problem]_solution.cpp`
