# Recursion
Welcome! This repository is meant for those who wish to learn about recursion in computer science. Each practice problem is accompanied by a problem description, solution, and explanation. All solutions are implemented in C++, though the solution explanations are written in pseudocode translatable to any language.

Each .cpp file can be organized into the following categories:
* Workspace. This is where the user can implement their solution according to the problem statement.
  * `[problem]_workspace.cpp`
* Solution. This is the C++ solution to the corresponding problem statement. These files include comments, however full solution explanations are provided elsewhere.
  * `[problem]_solution.cpp`

This repo was started on 29 December 2020, so it is still a work in progress. As the months progress, I should hopefully be able to create or find more and more problems for you to practice with!

## Dynamic Programming?
Though recursion is a key component in dynamic programming, that is not the focus of these practice problems. My primary intent is to help teach recursion in programming, not the nature of optimizing recursion.

That said, for some problems, there will be a portion of the problem statement which lists a required asymptotic runtime. This is optional, especially if the user is new to optimization. There will also be an extra portion of the explanation which explains how to modify the solution to improve runtime efficiency, via dynamic programming or otherwise.
